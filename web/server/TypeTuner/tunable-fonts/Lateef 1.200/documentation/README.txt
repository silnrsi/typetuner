Lateef Font
==========

Lateef is an extended Arabic script font designed by SIL International for
modern Unicode-based systems. It supports virtually all of the Unicode 4.1 
Arabic character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, 
which are not recommended for normal use). Lateef is currently available
in Regular weight only.

Named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi mystic and poet, 
this font is intended to be an appropriate style for use in Sindhi and other 
languages of the southern Asia.

Lateef provides a "simplified' rendering of Arabic script, using basic
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or
contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This simplified
style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages, but
may be considered unattractive in more traditional and literate communities.

Lateef is licensed under the SIL Open Font License. See OFL.txt and 
OFL-FAQ.txt for details.

See the FONTLOG for information on this and previous releases.
