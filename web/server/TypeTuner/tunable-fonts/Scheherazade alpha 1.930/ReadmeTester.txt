This package is provided for font testers for the Scheherazade alpha font,
version 1.900.

In order to provide you with the most options for testing the new Scheherazade 
we have included 3 fonts in this package:

     Scheherazade-R.ttf (called Scheherazade) - this is the new Scheherazade 
     test font. It is named "Scheherazade" in case you wish to install it and 
     open existing documents to see how your documents look.

     Scheherazade_alpha-R.ttf (called Scheherazade alpha) - this is the same 
     test font as above except that it is named "Scheherazade alpha" in case you 
     wish to install it along side the released Scheherazade and compare the two 
     fonts in new test documents.
    
     ScheherazadeOT-1.005.ttf (called ScheherazadeOT 1.005) - this is a renamed 
     version of the released Scheherazade. It is provided in case you wish to 
     install Scheherazade-R.ttf to use but still retain access to the released 
     Scheherazade.

We are looking for feedback on this font. We are interested in feedback on the
issues mentioned on this web page: http://scripts.sil.org/Scheherazade_alpha. 
as well as anything else that isn't working properly.

clarification. We will keep your address private.
