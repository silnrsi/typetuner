Harmattan font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Harmattan font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Harmattan fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the winter in West
Africa, is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages using
the Arabic script in West Africa. 

The font does not cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire. It only supports 
characters known to be used by languages in West Africa.

This font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex 
typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType and Graphite 
technologies.

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Harmattan Regular

For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Fouta", "Harmattan" and 
"SIL" in the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of 
Harmattan. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants 
through this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font
Names in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as 
long as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Harmattan" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Harmattan SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Fouta", "Harmattan" 
and "SIL" Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like 
"Nations Ajami".
