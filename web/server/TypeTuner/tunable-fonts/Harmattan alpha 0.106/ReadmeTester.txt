This package is provided for font testers for the Harmattan alpha font.

There is one font in this package:

     Harmattan_alpha-R.ttf (called Harmattan alpha) - the font is named 
     "Harmattan alpha". When the font is officially released it will be called
     "Harmattan". All of our documentation refers to using the "Harmattan"
     font. With this alpha font you will need to select "Harmattan alpha" rather
     than "Harmattan".
    
We are looking for feedback on this font. We are interested in feedback on the
issues mentioned on this web page: http://scripts.sil.org/Harmattan_alpha. 
as well as anything else that isn't working properly.

Please use the form on this webpage:
http://scripts.sil.org/Harmattan_alpha#feedback for bug submission. Your
email address is required because we may need to contact you for further
clarification. We will keep your address private.
