Known Issues

   We know of the following problems. Please report any others you encounter:
   
   There has been no manual hinting done, but we have improved the overall
   autohinting parameters. Still, onscreen display may at times be somewhat
   distorted. Please evaluate the letterforms from printed text, but let us
   know if you find severe distortions. In any case, the fonts should look
   fine when printed.
   
   Opening the font with FontLab 5.0.x, then closing it, crashes FontLab.
   We are working to get this bug fixed in the next version of FontLab.
   A workaround is to open the font, save as a .vfb file, close (which
   still causes a crash). Then restart FontLab and open the .vfb file.
   
   There are no alternate versions of fi and fl ligatures at this time.
