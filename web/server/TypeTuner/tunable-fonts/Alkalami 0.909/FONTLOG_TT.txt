FONTLOG 
Alkalami font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Alkalami font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Alkalami font 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Alkalami is an original, new design. It is designed for the style of Arabic
script used in the Kano region of Nigeria and Niger. 

The name Alkalami refers to the writing tool used by the Hausa people.

The font will not cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire. It will only 
support characters known to be used by languages using the Kano style of 
Arabic script.

This font will make use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex 
typographic issues. Font smarts will be implemented using OpenType only. We have 
no current plans to support Graphite.

Two weights will be included in this release:
     * Alkalami Regular
     * Alkalami Light

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Alkalami" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Alkalami. 
However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Alkalami" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Alkalami Hausa" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Alkalami" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Calamus Foo".
