Some facts that developers might like to know:

1. TYPETUNER INTERFACE

Presently this CGI script invokes TypeTuner in two ways:

	perl TypeTuner.pl -x output.xml input.ttf
	perl TypeTuner.pl [-n suffix] -o output.ttf applyset input.xml input.ttf

If the command line parameters to TypeTuner.pl change, this CGI scipt 
may need updating.


2. LINE ENDINGS MATTER

On xserve3 (scripts.sil.org), apparently the line-endings do matter for CGI
scripts. I've discovered that CRLF line endings don't work. Therefore I've
set the svn:eol-style property to LF making it possible to edit the file
on Windows and then scp it over to the appropriate folder on xserve.


3. XSERVE3 LOCATIONS

The URL to access this tool is: http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi

The relevant folders on xserve3 are:

/Volumes/Data/Web/NRSI/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw 
  -- root folder where the fonts2go.cgi should be located

/Volumes/Data/Web/NRSI/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner 
  -- subfolder  containing TypeTuner.pl

/Volumes/Data/Web/NRSI/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts
  -- subfolder containg source font packages. 

/Volumes/Data/Web/NRSI/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Andika Basic
/Volumes/Data/Web/NRSI/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Charis SIL 
/Volumes/Data/Web/NRSI/scripts.sil.org/cms/ttw/TypeTuner/tunable-fonts/Doulos SIL 
etc...
  -- subfolders containing source font packages. As of 2009-10-21 the names of 
     these subfolders may have spaces.
  -- In addition to the source font package, these folders may contain a file
     named ".help_url". The first line of this file should be the URL of a
     page or document that provides user help regarding the features supported
     by the fonts in the package. 
  -- Any file whose name ends in _TT (optionally followed by an extension, e.g.
     FONTLOG_TT.txt) is processed by a script that replaces %DATE% and
     %ISODATE% with the current date (Dallas timezone). The first of these
     will be in "dd MMM yyyy" format, the second in "yyyy-mm-dd" format. The
     resultant file will not include the "_TT" in its name.
